# training-docker-files

This docker image was made to help with my data science work flow. Specifically it allows me to quickly and easily set up the required versions of my tooling/packages (`python`, `R`, `xgboost`, `fastText` etc.) in a container on other machines.

The docker image can be pulled as is from directly from [my public docker repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/danielpnewman/training-tools/) using terminal command:

- `docker pull danielpnewman/training-tools`

Alternatively you can update my docker files and rebuild your own image using the steps below. :-)

### Files for making a docker image for model training using Python3.6, xgboost, fastText and other data science tools

1. If needed update the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) with required software.

2. If needed update [pip-req-frozen](pip_req_frozen.txt) with required python packages.

3. Build local docker image from Dockerfile in ~/training-docker-files directory, this code tags the image as as "danielpnewman/training-tools":

	- `cd training-docker-files`  
	- `docker build -t danielpnewman/training-tools .`

4. Put training data, scripts etc. into local `/to-mount` directory and then mount it into the docker container when you build it using this command:

	- `docker run --interactive --tty  --volume $(pwd)/to-mount:/training/to-mount danielpnewman/training-tools`

	- Note you can mount multiple directories:

		- `docker run --interactive --tty  --volume $(pwd)/to-mount:/training/to-mount --volume $(pwd)/scripts:/training/scrips danielpnewman/training-tools`

5.  You can close the terminal of an active docker session and then log back into it later using its CONTAINER ID, e.g:

 	- `exec -it d40b2796e7ca /bin/bash`

To push updated docker image to docker hub:
 `docker push danielpnewman/training-tools`
